##14 // Chain of twins

Twin primes that when added their sum is equal to the number 'in the middle' of other two larger primes. (5,7) â†’ (11,13) form a chain of size equal to 2. (5,7); 5 + 7 = 12; 12 is 'in the middle'of 11 and 13. 11 + 13 = 24 and 24 is not in the middle of twin primes (23 is prime but 25 is notprime), so the chain ends here.
